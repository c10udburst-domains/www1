the popular web application framework Ruby on Rails.</p>
<p>Ruby is also known for its focus on developer happiness and
productivity, with a strong emphasis on human-friendly design and a
philosophy of “optimizing for programmer joy.” The language has a strong
and supportive community, and it is often used for rapid prototyping and
web development due to its flexibility and ease of use.</p>
