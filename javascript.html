<p>JavaScript is a versatile and widely-used programming language that
is primarily used for web development. It allows developers to add
interactivity and dynamic features to websites. JavaScript runs on the
client-side, meaning it is executed by the user’s web browser. It is a
high-level language that is known for its flexibility and ability to
create interactive elements such as animations, form validation, and
dynamic content updates. With JavaScript, developers can enhance the
user experience and create engaging and interactive web
applications.</p>
