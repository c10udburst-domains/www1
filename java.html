<h4 id="the-java-programming-language">The Java Programming
Language</h4>
<p><strong>Java</strong> is a widely-used, high-level, object-oriented
programming language. It was developed by Sun Microsystems (now owned by
Oracle) and first released in 1995. Java is known for its “write once,
run anywhere” principle, which means that Java code can be compiled into
bytecode that can run on any Java Virtual Machine (JVM), making it
platform-independent. It is commonly used for building large-scale,
enterprise-level applications, as well as mobile applications (Android
development) and web applications. Java’s syntax is similar to C++,
making it relatively easy for programmers to transition from one
language to the other.</p>
