<p>Java is a high-level, general-purpose programming language that is
widely used for developing a variety of applications. It was first
released in 1995 and is known for its simplicity, readability, and
portability. Java programs are compiled into bytecode, which can be
executed on any platform that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM)
installed. Java offers a rich set of features, including object-oriented
programming, automatic memory management, and built-in libraries for
networking, graphics, and more. It is commonly used for developing web
applications, mobile apps, desktop software, and enterprise systems.
<strong>Java</strong> has a large and active community of developers,
making it a popular choice for both beginners and experienced
programmers.</p>
