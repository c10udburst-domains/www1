Language</strong></h4>
<p><strong>PHP</strong> is a widely-used open source general-purpose
scripting language that is especially suited for web development and can
be embedded into HTML. It was originally created by Rasmus Lerdorf in
1994 and stands for “PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor”. PHP code is usually
processed on a web server by a PHP interpreter implemented as a module,
a daemon, or as a Common Gateway Interface (CGI) executable. On a web
server, the result of the interpreted and executed PHP code, which may
be any type of data, such as generated HTML or binary image data, would
form the whole or part of an HTTP response. PHP can be used for many
programming tasks outside of web context, such as standalone graphical
applications and robotic drone control. PHP is a popular language for
web development and can be embedded into HTML. It is often used to
create dynamic content on websites.</p>
