Language?</h4>
<p><strong>C</strong> is a general-purpose, procedural computer
programming language developed by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Telephone
Laboratories in the early 1970s. It was designed for system programming,
but it is also widely used for developing applications. C has had a
massive influence on many other programming languages, and it is
commonly used in the development of operating systems, games, and
various applications.</p>
<p>C is known for its efficiency, flexibility, and portability, making
it a popular choice for many programmers and developers. It provides
low-level access to memory, and it requires minimal runtime support,
making it suitable for various applications, including embedded systems
and performance-critical tasks.</p>
<p>C is often considered a foundational language for learning
programming due to its close-to-the-hardware nature and its influence on
many modern programming languages.</p>
