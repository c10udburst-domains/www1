Markup Language</h4>

<p>Markdown works by using simple syntax elements to format text.
Instead of using HTML tags or complex formatting options, you can use
Markdown’s intuitive syntax to indicate how you want your text to
appear. For example, you can use a number sign (#) before a line of text
to create a heading, or two asterisks (**) to make a phrase bold <a
