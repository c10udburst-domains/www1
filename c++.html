language?</h4>
<p>The C++ programming language is a general-purpose programming
language that was developed as an extension of the C programming
language. It was created to provide additional features and capabilities
while maintaining compatibility with C. C++ supports object-oriented
programming (OOP) principles, such as classes and inheritance, as well
as features like templates, exception handling, and operator
overloading. It is widely used for developing a variety of applications,
including system software, game development, embedded systems, and
high-performance applications. C++ is known for its efficiency,
performance, and flexibility, making it a popular choice among
developers.</p>
