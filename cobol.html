<h4 id="cobol-programming-language-1">COBOL Programming Language</h4>
<p>COBOL (Common Business-Oriented Language) is a programming language
that was designed specifically for business data processing. It was
first introduced in the late 1950s and has since become one of the
oldest programming languages still in use today.</p>
<p><strong>Key Features of COBOL:</strong> - <strong>English-like
Syntax:</strong> COBOL was designed to be easily readable and
understandable by non-programmers. Its syntax resembles the English
language, making it more accessible for business professionals to read
and maintain the code. - <strong>Data Processing Focus:</strong> COBOL
was primarily developed for handling large-scale data processing tasks,
such as managing databases and performing calculations on business data.
- <strong>Record-Based Processing:</strong> COBOL supports record-based
processing, which is well-suited for handling data in files or
databases. It provides built-in features for reading, writing, and
manipulating records. - <strong>Decimal Arithmetic:</strong> COBOL has
built-in support for decimal arithmetic, making it suitable for
financial calculations that require high precision.</p>
<p>COBOL has been widely used in industries such as banking, finance,
and government, where legacy systems still rely on COBOL code. Despite
being an older language, COBOL continues to be used due to its
stability, reliability, and compatibility with existing systems.</p>
