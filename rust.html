<h4 id="what-is-the-rust-programming-language">What is the Rust
Programming Language?</h4>
<p><strong>Rust</strong> is a systems programming language that focuses
on safety, speed, and concurrency. It is designed to be memory-safe and
thread-safe while preventing many classes of bugs. Rust is often used
for building large, complex systems and is known for its performance and
reliability.</p>
<p>Rust’s key features include: - <strong>Memory Safety</strong>: Rust’s
ownership system and borrowing rules enable memory safety without
garbage collection. - <strong>Concurrency</strong>: Rust provides
built-in support for concurrent programming. -
<strong>Performance</strong>: It aims to provide performance similar to
C and C++.</p>
<p>Rust is commonly used for systems programming, game engines, and
other performance-critical applications.</p>
