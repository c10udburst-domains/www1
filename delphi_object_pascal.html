Programming Language</h4>
<p><strong>Delphi</strong> is a general-purpose programming language and
a software product that uses the Delphi dialect of the <strong>Object
Pascal</strong> programming language. It provides an integrated
development environment (IDE) for rapid application development of
desktop, mobile, web, and console software. Delphi’s compilers generate
native code for Microsoft Windows, macOS, iOS, Android, and Linux (x64).
The language is strongly typed and high-level, intended to be easy to
use and is based on the earlier Object Pascal language <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delphi_(software)">[2]</a>.</p>
<p>Object Pascal is a derivative of the Pascal programming language,
originally developed as a teaching language by Niklaus Wirth. It was
later enhanced to support object-oriented programming and became known
as Object Pascal. Delphi’s dialect of Object Pascal is used for
developing a wide range of software applications and is known for its
ease of use and rapid development capabilities <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delphi_(software)">[2]</a>.</p>
<p>Overall, Delphi/Object Pascal is a versatile programming language
used for developing software across various platforms, including
desktop, mobile, web, and console applications, and is known for its
strong typing and high-level syntax <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delphi_(software)">[2]</a>.</p>

Pascal, I can provide further details!</p>
