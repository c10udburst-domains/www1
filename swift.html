<h4 id="swift-programming-language-1"><strong>Swift Programming
Language</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Swift</strong> is a general-purpose, multi-paradigm
programming language developed by Apple. It is designed to work with
Apple’s Cocoa and Cocoa Touch frameworks, and it is intended to be more
resilient and easier to understand than Objective-C. Swift is known for
its safety features, concise syntax, and performance. It is commonly
used for developing iOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS applications.
Additionally, Swift is open-source, which allows developers to
contribute to its ongoing development and improvement.</p>
