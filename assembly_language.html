Programming Language</h4>
<p><strong>Assembly language</strong> is a low-level programming
language that is closely related to machine code. It uses mnemonic codes
and symbols to represent the instructions and data that a computer can
understand. Assembly language is specific to a particular computer
architecture and provides a more human-readable representation of
machine code.</p>
<p>Assembly language is often used when direct control over hardware
resources is required or when high performance is critical. It allows
programmers to write code that is more efficient and optimized for
specific tasks. However, it is also more complex and requires a deeper
understanding of computer architecture.</p>
<p>Some key features of assembly language include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Mnemonic codes</strong>: Assembly language uses mnemonic
codes, which are abbreviations for machine instructions. These codes are
easier to remember and understand than the binary representation of
machine code.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Registers</strong>: Assembly language provides direct
access to the computer’s registers, which are small storage locations
within the CPU. This allows for efficient manipulation of data and
control flow.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Low-level operations</strong>: Assembly language provides
fine-grained control over the computer’s hardware resources, allowing
programmers to perform operations such as bit manipulation and direct
memory access.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Efficiency</strong>: Assembly language programs can be
highly optimized for performance, as programmers have direct control
over the underlying hardware.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Platform-specific</strong>: Assembly language is specific
to a particular computer architecture, so programs written in assembly
language are not portable across different systems.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Assembly language is often used in embedded systems, device drivers,
operating systems, and other performance-critical applications where
low-level control is required.</p>
